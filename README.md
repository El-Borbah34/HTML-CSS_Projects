# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This repository contains all of my assignments and projects that pertains with HTML and CSS during my four and a half months @The Tech Academy. These assignments and projects range anywhere from basic understanding of both, to how to implement both together to make a website(basic) that has some style and some functionality.

## Reason
This respository allowed me to gain the knowledge of basic to complex web design, by being able to keep track of my progress as well as being able to go back and see what I learned and how I learned it. I now have the ability to create a website that anyone can pick up and understand.

## Please feel free to look through my repository!
As I am the only one who added and updated this repo, it contains all my work centered around HTML and CSS. Feel free to reach out and ask me any questions that come to mind. The final project in this repo will be my One-Page-Website.
